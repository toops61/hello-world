# hello-world
first steps project
This is my first Git's project. A first step.
I've been practicing and creating music for more than 20 years now and i'm also a sound engineer. The idea was to be able to produce myself without any help : composing, arrangements, recording, mixing, even the music video we made it ourselves.
